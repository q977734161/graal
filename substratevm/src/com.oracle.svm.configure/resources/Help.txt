GraalVM native-image-configure tool

This tool can be used to prepare a configuration of JNI, reflection and
resources for a native-image build.

Usage: native-image-configure generate [options]
       native-image-configure help

generate                  generates configuration file(s) from all inputs.
    --trace-input=<path>
                          reads and processes a trace file at the given path.
    --input-dir=<path>
                          reads a set of configuration files from the directory
                          at the given path. This is equivalent to all of:
                           --reflect-input=<path>/reflect-config.json
                           --jni-input=<path>/jni-config.json
                           --proxy-input=<path>/proxy-config.json
                           --resource-input=<path>/resource-config.json
    --reflect-input=<path>
                          reads a reflection configuration file at <path>.
    --jni-input=<path>
                          reads a JNI configuration file at <path>.
    --proxy-input=<path>
                          reads a dynamic proxy configuration file at <path>.
    --resource-input=<path>
                          reads a resource configuration file at <path>.
    --output-dir=<path>
                          writes a set of configuration files to the directory
                          at the given path. Existing files are replaced. This
                          option is equivalent to all of:
                           --reflect-output=<path>/reflect-config.json
                           --jni-output=<path>/jni-config.json
                           --proxy-output=<path>/proxy-config.json
                           --resource-output=<path>/resource-config.json
    --reflect-output=<path>
                          write a reflection configuration file to <path>. This
                          file can be later provided to native-image with
                          -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=<path>.
    --jni-output=<path>
                          write a JNI configuration file to <path>. This file
                          can be later provided to native-image with
                          -H:JNIConfigurationFiles=<path>.
    --proxy-output=<path>
                          write a dynamic proxy configuration file to <path>.
                          This file can be later provided to native-image with
                          -H:DynamicProxyConfigurationFiles=<path>.
    --resource-output=<path>
                          write a configuration file containing used resources
                          (getResource) to <path>. This file can later be
                          provided to native-image with
                          -H:ResourceConfigurationFiles=<path>.
                          The paths in the configuration file might need to be
                          adjusted for the build directories/classpath.
    --no-filter
                          usage of JNI, reflection and resources in internal
                          classes does not need to be configured for builds
                          with native-image and by default, is excluded from
                          the generated configurations. This option disables
                          this filter.
